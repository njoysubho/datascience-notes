# Image Segmentation

## Notes

* Image Segmentation is the process to assign a unique class to each pixel in the image.

* We have a image file and a ground truth mask file. 
* Use Albumentation instead of pytorch transform it has a nice utility method transform that will apply the same transformation to image file and mask.
